# Ch3Hw
The Chapter3HW package contains exercises 1 2 and 3. Exercise 1 consists of a main super abstract class FarmAnimal that 3 sub classes Duck, Cow, and Chicken extend from. Exercise 2 consists of one interface Flight and two classes Airplane and Bird that implement the flight() method from Flight class. Exercise 3 builds on this and adds a Movement Interface that extends Flight and adds two more methods, jump() and walk() for Airplane and Bird classes to inherit. Exercises 1, 2, and 3 each have their own Main class to wich create Objects and call their methods (MyFarm, ThingsThatFly, and ThingsThatMove respectively).
